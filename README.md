- **Graphics Library:** OpenGL with FreeGLUT for rendering
- **Development Tools:** GCC Compiler and an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Code::Blocks)

### Initial Setup
The initial setup involved:
1. Linking the FreeGLUT library.
2. Creating a basic window to render the game environment.

## Features
- Basic window rendering.
- Integration with the FreeGLUT library.
- Setup for further graphics and game development.

## Prerequisites
Make sure the following tools and libraries are installed on your system:
- GCC Compiler
- FreeGLUT Library
- Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or another C++ IDE

### Installation
