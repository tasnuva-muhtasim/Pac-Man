Environment Setup
The development environment was configured with the following tools and libraries:
• Programming Language: C++.
• Graphics Library: OpenGL with FreeGLUT for rendering.
• Development Tools: GCC Compiler and a suitable IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Code::Blocks).
The initial setup involved linking the FreeGLUT library and creating a basic window to render
the game environment.
